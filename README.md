# JS for humans üë®‚Äçüíª

I created this repo for educational purposes and you are all welcome to contribute and add useful information about JS - so we all could become better devs! 

For now, this repo contains only a few sections but I'm planning to add new ones every week. The information is written in an easy to understand format with simple examples to demonstrate concepts.  

If you notice any mistakes or inaccurate explanations - please make a PR so everyone can enjoy accurate information! :smile:
